# Annex 1 DRIVER+ Terminology

In order to have a common understanding within the DRIVER+ project and beyond and to ensure the use of a common language in all project deliverables and communications, a terminology is developed by making reference to main sources, such as ISO standards and UNISDR. This terminology is presented online as part of the Portfolio of Solutions and it will be continuously reviewed and updated[^1]. The terminology is applied throughout the documents produced by DRIVER+. Each deliverable includes an annex as provided hereunder, which holds an extract from the comprehensive terminology containing the relevant DRIVER+ terms for this respective document.

| Terminology | Definition for DRIVER+ | Source |
|-------------|------------------------|--------|
| Crisis management | Holistic management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten an organization and provides a framework for building resilience, with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of the organization's key interested parties, reputation, brand and value creating activities, as well as effectively restoring operational capabilities. Note to entry: Crisis management also involves the management of preparedness, mitigation, response, and continuity or recovery in the event of an incident, as well as management of the overall programme through training, rehearsals and reviews to ensure the preparedness, response and continuity plans stay current and up-to-date. | ISO22300:2018 (en)
| Evaluation | Process of estimating the effectiveness, efficiency, utility and relevance of a service or facility. | ISO 5127:2017(en) Information and documentation — Foundation and vocabulary, 3.1.3.02.
| Exercise | Process to train for, assess, practise and improve performance in an organization. Note 1 to entry: Exercises can be used for validating policies, plans, procedures, training , equipment, and inter-organizational agreements; clarifying and training personnel in roles and responsibilities; improving inter­organizational coordination and communications; identifying gaps in resources; improving individual performance and identifying opportunities for improvement; and a controlled opportunity to practise improvisation. Note 2 to entry: See also test. | ISO22300:2018(en) 11
| Experiment | Purposive investigation of a system through selective adjustment of controllable conditions and allocation of resources. DRIVER+ Note 1: Please consider also the notes in the original definition. DRIVER+ Note 2: In the context of DRIVER+ Trials are executed - and not experiments. | [ISO/TR 13195:2015(en)](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:tr:13195:ed-1:v1:en) Selected illustrations of response surface method — Central composite design
| Legacy systems | (Crisis management) system currently in operational use. | Initial DRIVER definition
|Trial | An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach. | Initial DRIVER+ definition.
| Trial Guidance Methodology (TGM) | A structured approach from designing a Trial to evaluating the outcomes and identifying lessons learned | Initial DRIVER+ definition
| Trial Guidance Tool | A software tool that guides Trial design, execution and evaluation in a step-by-step way (according to the Trial Guidance Methodology) including as much of the necessary information as possible in form of data or references to the Portfolio of Solutions | Initial DRIVER+ definition
| Observer | Observer participant who witnesses the exercise while remaining separate from exercise activities. Note 1 to entry: Observers may be part of the evaluation process. | ISO 22300:2018(en) Societal security — Terminology.
| Portfolio of Solutions (PoS) | A database driven web site that documents the available Crisis Management solutions. The PoS includes information on the experiences with a solution (i.e. results and outcomes of Trials), the needs it addresses, the type of practitioner organisations that have used it, the regulatory conditions that apply, societal impact consideration, a glossary, and the design of the Trials. | Initial DRIVER+ definition.
