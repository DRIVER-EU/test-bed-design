| Trial Guidance Methodology (TGM) | A structured approach from designing a Trial to evaluating the outcomes and identifying lessons learned	| DoW
| Guidance Tool	| A software tool that guides Trial design, execution and evaluation in a step-by-step way including as much of the necessary information as possible in form of data or references to the portfolio of solutions | DoW
| Interoperability | The ability of diverse systems and organisations to work together, i.e. to interoperate.	| ISO 22397
| Legacy systems | (Crisis management) system currently in operational use. | Initial DRIVER definition
| Observer | Exercise participant who watches selected segments as they unfold while remaining separate from role player activities [DRAFT 22300: 2017-- observer participant (3.163) who witnesses the exercise (3.83) while remaining separate from exercise activities Note 1 to entry: Observers may be part of the evaluation (3.81) process (3.180).] | ISO 22300:2012(en) Societal security — Terminology, 2.4.5 [addition in DRAFT 2017]
