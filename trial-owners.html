<p>This Chapter discusses the <strong>future</strong> Test-bed functionality that could benefit a practitioner, so although most functionality can already be realized today, not everything is in place yet.</p>
<p><a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="A Trial is a test of the performance, qualities, or suitability of a solution. A solution, in this context, is something that solves a crisis management gap.">Trial</a> owners will interact with the Test-bed when they want to <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="A Trial is a test of the performance, qualities, or suitability of a solution. A solution, in this context, is something that solves a crisis management gap.">Trial</a> one or more solutions. Since Trials vary in complexity and scope, not all <a href="GLOSSARY.html#tgm" class="glossary-term" title="Trial Guidance Methodology, see also DRIVER+ deliverable D922.21 - Trial guidance methodology and guidance tool specifications (version 1).">TGM</a> steps may be required for every <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="A Trial is a test of the performance, qualities, or suitability of a solution. A solution, in this context, is something that solves a crisis management gap.">Trial</a>. On the one side of the spectrum, the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="A Trial is a test of the performance, qualities, or suitability of a solution. A solution, in this context, is something that solves a crisis management gap.">Trial</a> may be more like a simple and inexpensive software <strong>test</strong>, in which a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="A Trial is a test of the performance, qualities, or suitability of a solution. A solution, in this context, is something that solves a crisis management gap.">Trial</a> Owner can verify that a Solution has useful features, is user-friendly, looks good, and does not crash. Typically, this would be done with only a few people. For a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cm" class="glossary-term" title="Crisis Management, a holistic management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten an organization and provides a framework for building resilience, with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of the organization&apos;s key interested parties, reputation, brand and value creating activities, as well as effectively restoring operational capabilities. Note to entry: Crisis management also involves the management of preparedness, mitigation, response, and continuity or recovery in the event of an incident, as well as management of the overall programme through training, rehearsals and reviews to ensure the preparedness, response and continuity plans stay current and up-to-date.">CM</a> Solution, such a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="A Trial is a test of the performance, qualities, or suitability of a solution. A solution, in this context, is something that solves a crisis management gap.">Trial</a> also requires (some components of) the Test-bed, together with a test-scenario. The test-scenario allows you to test the solution in a relevant context.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, if one would test a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cop" class="glossary-term" title="Common Operational Picture tools for creating a shared situational awareness">COP</a> tool as is, it would probably not have any map layers, basically showing an empty map. Using a test-scenario, the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cop" class="glossary-term" title="Common Operational Picture tools for creating a shared situational awareness">COP</a> tool can be tested in the context of a simple incident, perhaps a flooding, have some ambulances driving around, and map layers showing population information, locations of critical infrastructure, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other side of the spectrum, a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="A Trial is a test of the performance, qualities, or suitability of a solution. A solution, in this context, is something that solves a crisis management gap.">Trial</a> could involve multiple Solutions, many participants and observers, in a more realistic, operational-like scenario, with proper data collection and evaluation along all dimensions in place. In this case, the full <a href="GLOSSARY.html#tgm" class="glossary-term" title="Trial Guidance Methodology, see also DRIVER+ deliverable D922.21 - Trial guidance methodology and guidance tool specifications (version 1).">TGM</a> should be applied to perform a proper <strong>assessment</strong> and funded conclusions can be drawn. As the latter requires a serious investment in time, people and budget, a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="A Trial is a test of the performance, qualities, or suitability of a solution. A solution, in this context, is something that solves a crisis management gap.">Trial</a> Owner may consider to combine the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="A Trial is a test of the performance, qualities, or suitability of a solution. A solution, in this context, is something that solves a crisis management gap.">Trial</a> with a planned <a href="GLOSSARY.html#exercise" class="glossary-term" title="An exercise is an activity carried out to train personnel and processes in crisis management.">exercise</a> to reduce the costs of preparing, executing and evaluating a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="A Trial is a test of the performance, qualities, or suitability of a solution. A solution, in this context, is something that solves a crisis management gap.">Trial</a>.</p>
<p>For simple as well as complex cases, the Test-bed supports practitioners by providing an environment in which they can easily <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="A Trial is a test of the performance, qualities, or suitability of a solution. A solution, in this context, is something that solves a crisis management gap.">Trial</a> new solutions and run exercises:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Preparation support:</strong> When preparing a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="A Trial is a test of the performance, qualities, or suitability of a solution. A solution, in this context, is something that solves a crisis management gap.">Trial</a>, practitioners can use the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#scenario-manager" class="glossary-term" title="The Scenario Manager acts as the composer and conductor of a classical performance:">Scenario Manager</a> tool to create one or more scenarios for the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="A Trial is a test of the performance, qualities, or suitability of a solution. A solution, in this context, is something that solves a crisis management gap.">Trial</a>. In addition, they can already document the observations they wish to see using the Observer Support Tool. As part of the preparation, the Test-bed also offers:<ul>
<li><strong>Simulation support:</strong> Due to the nature of the crisis management domain, most solutions cannot be properly tested outside an actual crisis situation. As starting a flooding or burning a forest is clearly not an option to test the solutions, the crisis incident needs to be faked or simulated. The same applies to expected reactions of the environment: people panicking, traffic jams, etc. must be simulated too. As most <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cm" class="glossary-term" title="Crisis Management, a holistic management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten an organization and provides a framework for building resilience, with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of the organization&apos;s key interested parties, reputation, brand and value creating activities, as well as effectively restoring operational capabilities. Note to entry: Crisis management also involves the management of preparedness, mitigation, response, and continuity or recovery in the event of an incident, as well as management of the overall programme through training, rehearsals and reviews to ensure the preparedness, response and continuity plans stay current and up-to-date.">CM</a> simulators cannot simulate realistically all types of incident and reactions, the Test-bed supports multiple simulators so they can collaborate and create the desired fictitious incident.</li>
<li><strong>Solution support:</strong> The new and shiny <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cop" class="glossary-term" title="Common Operational Picture tools for creating a shared situational awareness">COP</a> tool or other solution that is being evaluated never acts standalone in a void. Normally, solutions need to exchange information with other (legacy) solutions too, which is also supported by the Test-bed.</li>
<li><strong>Development support:</strong> To connect new solutions and simulators to the Test-bed, the Test-bed provides adapters in several popular languages and several debugging tools and services. Also, to check whether everything is up-and-running smoothly, developers and system operators can use the Admin tool.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Execution support:</strong> Scenarios created during the preparation phase can be &apos;executed&apos;, or played, in order to control the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="A Trial is a test of the performance, qualities, or suitability of a solution. A solution, in this context, is something that solves a crisis management gap.">Trial</a>. And the scenario time is controllable too.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluation support:</strong> As we are testing and evaluating new solutions, the Test-bed provides the After-Action Review tool for capturing and reviewing sent messages and the Observer Support tool to capture observations. In addition, the exchanged information can be logged and processed for further evaluation after the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="A Trial is a test of the performance, qualities, or suitability of a solution. A solution, in this context, is something that solves a crisis management gap.">Trial</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following sections, a use case (storyline) description of each is provided. The main actor in each story is Monica, a regional crisis manager with a professional background in fire-fighting. One of the challenges she is facing is that she does not always have a good overview of where her people and trucks are during a large-scale fire, and she is looking for a solution. Please also have a look at the animation, which is available online at <a href="https://vimeo.com/299680658" target="_blank">https://vimeo.com/299680658</a>.</p>

<h2 id="21-use-case-evaluating-a-solution-standalone">2.1 Use Case: Evaluating a solution standalone</h2>
<p>Monica has heard about an interesting <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cop" class="glossary-term" title="Common Operational Picture tools for creating a shared situational awareness">COP</a> solution via the DRIVER+ Portfolio of Solutions. She considers using it to address her problems in fighting fires. After defining the gaps and specifying the requirements, according to the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#tgm" class="glossary-term" title="Trial Guidance Methodology, see also DRIVER+ deliverable D922.21 - Trial guidance methodology and guidance tool specifications (version 1).">TGM</a>, she continues in an iterative way:</p>
<ol>
<li>Monica, perhaps supported by an IT professional, visits the Test-bed&apos;s <a href="https://driver-eu.github.io/docker-composer" target="_blank">composer website</a> (see Figure 4). <em>It allows her, or anyone else, to specify the technical components that should make up the Test-bed. It can be compared to buying a car: do you select an air conditioner, cruise control, and a solar screen, or can you live without them.</em></li>
<li>She opens the solution&apos;s tab and sees that the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cop" class="glossary-term" title="Common Operational Picture tools for creating a shared situational awareness">COP</a> tool is available for evaluation. <em>In the future, available solutions could be linked to the Portfolio of Solutions.</em></li>
<li>She selects it in the menu (see Figure 5).</li>
<li>She understands that it is difficult to test a solution without any data / scenario, so she visits the data tab and selects a fire-fighting data set situated in the South of France: <em>It involves a large-scale forest fire, which is rapidly spreading. Ambulances and fire trucks are deployed and driving around. She can also look at census data of the area and a weather report.</em></li>
</ol>

<p><em>From here on forwards, two alternatives are presented. The first one represents the desired situation. The second alternative is already in place.</em></p>
<h3 id="alternative-1-cloud-scenario">Alternative 1: Cloud scenario</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>As she currently is not interested in other solutions, she opens the menu and clicks on the DEPLOY button. A dialog opens and informs her to wait while her selected Test-bed is started in the cloud.</p>
</li>
<li><p>After a brief moment, the Test-bed is running and she gets her own unique link. She visits this website, and is presented with a simple menu: she can start (pause | stop) the fire fighting scenario, and open the website of the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cop" class="glossary-term" title="Common Operational Picture tools for creating a shared situational awareness">COP</a> tool. <em>In its layer menu, she can turn on the layer which shows the ambulances and fire trucks. There are also options to turn on the fire fighting layer to show the location of vehicles and staff, etc.</em></p>

</ol>
<h3 id="alternative-2-local-scenario">Alternative 2: Local scenario</h3>

<li><p>As she currently is not interested in other solutions, she opens the menu and clicks on the BUILD button. A dialog opens and she can download the <em><a href="GLOSSARY.html#docker" class="glossary-term" title="Docker is a free software application, available on Linux, Mac and Windows, which offers a way to run other applications in its own sand-box environment without requiring installation.

<p>In order to run a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="A Trial is a test of the performance, qualities, or suitability of a solution. A solution, in this context, is something that solves a crisis management gap.">Trial</a>, a similar process as described above could be followed. The main difference is that more services and solutions will be added, and more people are involved. In addition, the Test-bed is needed already well-before the final <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="A Trial is a test of the performance, qualities, or suitability of a solution. A solution, in this context, is something that solves a crisis management gap.">Trial</a> date, since:</p>
<ul>
<li>The scenario is created iteratively.</li>
<li>Not all solutions or simulators are already able to connect to the Test-bed. So even before the first dry-runs, solutions and simulators should be able to test their connection and integration.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, Monica is supported by the local <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cm" class="glossary-term" title="Crisis Management, a holistic management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten an organization and provides a framework for building resilience, with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of the organization&apos;s key interested parties, reputation, brand and value creating activities, as well as effectively restoring operational capabilities. Note to entry: Crisis management also involves the management of preparedness, mitigation, response, and continuity or recovery in the event of an incident, as well as management of the overall programme through training, rehearsals and reviews to ensure the preparedness, response and continuity plans stay current and up-to-date.">CM</a> expertise centre, which could also be offered via a consultant, a simulator owner, or otherwise, which helps her in setting up the required infrastructure.</p>
<ol>
<li>She contacts one of the local <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cm" class="glossary-term" title="Crisis Management, a holistic management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten an organization and provides a framework for building resilience, with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of the organization&apos;s key interested parties, reputation, brand and value creating activities, as well as effectively restoring operational capabilities. Note to entry: Crisis management also involves the management of preparedness, mitigation, response, and continuity or recovery in the event of an incident, as well as management of the overall programme through training, rehearsals and reviews to ensure the preparedness, response and continuity plans stay current and up-to-date.">CM</a> expertise centres, and request a Test-bed in the cloud. It is created for her instantly.</li>
<li>She contacts the solution provider, and informs him of her Test-bed. This solution owner can contact the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cm" class="glossary-term" title="Crisis Management, a holistic management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten an organization and provides a framework for building resilience, with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of the organization&apos;s key interested parties, reputation, brand and value creating activities, as well as effectively restoring operational capabilities. Note to entry: Crisis management also involves the management of preparedness, mitigation, response, and continuity or recovery in the event of an incident, as well as management of the overall programme through training, rehearsals and reviews to ensure the preparedness, response and continuity plans stay current and up-to-date.">CM</a> expertise centre, and with help of its IT staff, are able to connect to Monica&apos;s Test-bed, so Monica can have a first look. This connection to the Test-bed is needed, so the Solution can receive information about an fictitious incident, or from other solutions in a more complex <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="A Trial is a test of the performance, qualities, or suitability of a solution. A solution, in this context, is something that solves a crisis management gap.">Trial</a>.</li>
<li>As part of the online Test-bed, she now has access to the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#scenario-manager" class="glossary-term" title="The Scenario Manager acts as the composer and conductor of a classical performance:">Scenario Manager</a> Tool (SMT, see ??? <em>under development</em>), which allows her or one of her <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cm" class="glossary-term" title="Crisis Management, a holistic management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten an organization and provides a framework for building resilience, with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of the organization&apos;s key interested parties, reputation, brand and value creating activities, as well as effectively restoring operational capabilities. Note to entry: Crisis management also involves the management of preparedness, mitigation, response, and continuity or recovery in the event of an incident, as well as management of the overall programme through training, rehearsals and reviews to ensure the preparedness, response and continuity plans stay current and up-to-date.">CM</a> colleagues, to create the outlines of several wildfire scenarios by recording the main flow of events during an incident. The scenario is key in that it translates specific objectives to a storyline so the solutions or people can be put to the test:</li>
<li>As the SMT does not create the actual incident itself, she realizes that she needs some simulators to simulate a wildfire, traffic and evacuating civilians. In DRIVER+&apos;s Portfolio of Solutions, she finds several simulators that are compatible with the Test-bed and contacts their owners. The simulation providers, like the solutions provider, are able to connect to Monica&apos;s Test-bed too. Alternatively, it may be offered by the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cm" class="glossary-term" title="Crisis Management, a holistic management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten an organization and provides a framework for building resilience, with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of the organization&apos;s key interested parties, reputation, brand and value creating activities, as well as effectively restoring operational capabilities.

Using the Test-bed connection, the simulators can send incident information to the connected Solution, which it can display. In addition, simulators can share information too, so simulated people do not walk happily through the fire!</li>
<li>Monica asks one of her colleagues to detail the questions for the observers, which he can document in the Observer Support Tool.</li>
<li>During a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="A Trial is a test of the performance, qualities, or suitability of a solution. A solution, in this context, is something that solves a crisis management gap.">Trial</a>, Monica can start the scenario. The <a href="GLOSSARY.html#scenario-manager" class="glossary-term" title="The Scenario Manager acts as the composer and conductor of a classical performance:">Scenario Manager</a> Tool instructs everyone when to perform their planned act. For example, the SMT instructs the Observer Support Tool to send the first set of questions to the observers. Monica can also control the scenario time, for example by freezing the time during a break. In case the users of a Solution missed an important test moment, she can also invoke optional storylines or acts, so the Solution and its users get another chance to prove itself.</li>
