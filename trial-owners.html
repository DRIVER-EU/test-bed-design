<p>In the following sections, a use case (storyline) description of each is provided. The main actor in each story is Monica, a regional crisis manager with a professional background in fire-fighting. One of the challenges she is facing is that she does now always have a good overview of where her people and trucks are during a large-scale fire, and she is looking for a solution.</p>
<h2 id="31-use-case-evaluating-a-solution-standalone">3.1 Use Case: Evaluating a solution standalone</h2>
<p>Monica has heard about an interesting <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cop" class="glossary-term" title="Common Operational Picture tools for creating a shared situational awareness">COP</a> solution, <em>csCOP</em> via the DRIVER+ Portfolio of Solutions. She considers using it to address her problems</p>
<ol>
<li>Monica visits the Test-bed&apos;s <a href="https://driver-eu.github.io/docker-composer" target="_blank">composer website</a> (see Figure 11).</li>
<li>She briefly reads its homepage, which explains her what to do next.</li>
<li>She opens the solution&apos;s tab and sees that <em>csCOP</em> is available for evaluation.</li>
<li>She select <em>csCOP</em> in the menu (see Figure 12).</li>
<li>She understands that it is difficult to test a solution without any data / scenario, so she visits the data tab and selects a fire-fighting data set situated in the South of France: <em>It involves a large-scale forest fire, which is rapidly spreading. Ambulances and fire trucks are deployed and driving around. She can also look at census data of the area and a weather report.</em></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="alternative-1-cloud-scenario">Alternative 1: Cloud scenario</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>As she currently isn&apos;t interested in other solutions, she opens the menu and clicks on the DEPLOY button. A dialog opens and informs her to wait while her selected Test-bed is started in the cloud.</p>
</li>
<li><p>After a minute or so, the Test-bed is running and she gets her own unique link. She visits this website, and is presented with a simple menu: she can start (pause | stop) the fire fighting scenario, and open the website of the <em>csCOP</em> tool. <em>In its layer menu, she can turn on the layer which shows the ambulances and fire trucks. There are also options to turn on the fire fighting layer to show the location of vehicles and staff, etc.</em></p>

</ol>
<h3 id="alternative-2-local-scenario">Alternative 2: Local scenario</h3>

<li><p>As she currently isn&apos;t interested in other solutions, she opens the menu and clicks on the BUILD button.

<h2 id="32-use-case-assessing-solutions-using-a-trial">3.2 Use Case: Assessing solutions using a Trial</h2>
<p>In order to run a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="A Trial is a test of the performance, qualities, or suitability of a solution. A solution, in this context, is something that solves a crisis management gap.">Trial</a>, the same process as described above is followed. The main difference is that more services and solutions will be added, and in many cases, perhaps for security reasons, the Test-bed is run locally on the internal network. Basically, instead of only using the Test-bed core&apos;s services, a more complete Test-bed is required, also containing the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#observer-tool" class="glossary-term" title="The online observer support tool facilitates the task of the observer by providing him or her with pre-made questions that can be easily answered during a Trial or exercise, and scenario triggers informing the observer of things to come. In addition, these responses will be harvested by the Test-bed, and used for evaluation at the end of the exercise.">observer tool</a>, <a href="GLOSSARY.html#aar" class="glossary-term" title="The After-Action Review (AAR) tool provides the possibility to collect data after a Trial has finished and analyse it. Its main purpose is to facilitate the evaluation of the trialled solutions against the predefined objectives, and to help the participants determine how well they functioned.

<p>In addition, the Test-bed is needed already well-before the final <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="A Trial is a test of the performance, qualities, or suitability of a solution. A solution, in this context, is something that solves a crisis management gap.">Trial</a> date, since:</p>
<ul>
<li>The scenario must be created iteratively.</li>
<li>Not all solutions or simulators are already able to connect to the Test-bed. So even before the first dry-runs, solutions and simulators should be able to test their connection and integration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Typically, setting up the Test-bed for a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="A Trial is a test of the performance, qualities, or suitability of a solution. A solution, in this context, is something that solves a crisis management gap.">Trial</a>  would not be performed by the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="A Trial is a test of the performance, qualities, or suitability of a solution. A solution, in this context, is something that solves a crisis management gap.">Trial</a> owner herself. Most likely, she will be supported by a local system administrator or consultant to help her decide what she needs, and to prepare the technical infrastructure.</p>
<p>When the Test-bed is running, though, the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="A Trial is a test of the performance, qualities, or suitability of a solution. A solution, in this context, is something that solves a crisis management gap.">Trial</a> owner has to take responsibility again for defining the scenario in case she has not delegated this task. The scenario is key in that it translates specific objectives to a storyline so the solutions or people can be put to the test.</p>
<p>As the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#scenario-manager" class="glossary-term" title="The Scenario Manager acts as the composer and conductor of a classical performance:">Scenario Manager</a> is not available in the current version of the Test-bed, only a brief outline can be provided.

<li>An overall scenario is described that can put these objectives to the test.</li>
<li>Specific storylines are created to stress the solutions.</li>
