<p>This Chapter discusses the <strong>future</strong> Test-bed functionality that could benefit a practitioner, so although 95% of the  functionality can already be realized today, not everything is in place yet and we will continue improving it until February 2020.</p>
<p><a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> owners will interact with the Test-bed when they want to <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> one or more solutions (see Figure 4).

On the one side of the spectrum, the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> may be more like a simple and inexpensive software <strong>test</strong>, in which a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> Owner can verify that a Solution has useful features, is user-friendly, looks good, and does not crash. Typically, this would be done with only a few people.

<p>For example, if one would test a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cop" class="glossary-term" title="Common Operational Picture tools for creating a shared situational awareness">COP</a> tool as is, it would probably not have any map layers, basically showing an empty map. Using a test-scenario, the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cop" class="glossary-term" title="Common Operational Picture tools for creating a shared situational awareness">COP</a> tool can be tested in the context of a simple incident, perhaps a wildfire, displaying the actual locations of fire trucks and firemen, and map layers showing population information, locations of critical infrastructure, fire hydrants, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other side of the spectrum, a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> could involve multiple Solutions, many participants and observers, in a more realistic, operational-like scenario, with proper data collection and evaluation along all dimensions in place. In this case, the full <a href="GLOSSARY.html#tgm" class="glossary-term" title="Trial Guidance Methodology, see also DRIVER+ deliverable D922.21 - Trial guidance methodology and guidance tool specifications (version 1).">TGM</a> should be applied to perform a proper <strong>assessment</strong> and funded conclusions can be drawn. As the latter requires a serious investment in time, people and budget, a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> Owner may consider to combine the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> with a planned <a href="GLOSSARY.html#exercise" class="glossary-term" title="An exercise is an activity carried out to train personnel and processes in crisis management.">exercise</a> to reduce the costs of preparing, executing and evaluating a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>.</p>

<p>The Test-bed is, however, also suitable for supporting table top exercises or field exercises, since it contains all the components that are required for it: a common information and simulation space to exchange information between tools, the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>-Management-Tool for creating and running scenario&apos;s, and review and observer support tools.

</blockquote>
<p>For simple as well as complex cases, the Test-bed supports practitioners by providing an environment in which they can easily <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> new solutions and run exercises:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Preparation support:</strong> When preparing a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>, <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> staff can use the <a href="test-bed-description.html#scenario-management-using-the-trial-management-tool-tmt">Trial-Management-Tool</a> tool to create one or more scenarios for the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>. In addition, they can already document the observations they wish to see using the <a href="test-bed-description.html#observer-support-tool-ost">Observer Support Tool</a>. As part of the preparation, the Test-bed also offers the <a href="test-bed-description.html#32-test-bed-administration-tool">Admin tool</a> to manage the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>&apos;s technical setup, and:<ul>
<li><strong>Simulation support:</strong> Due to the nature of the crisis management domain, most solutions cannot be properly tested outside an actual crisis situation. As starting a flooding or burning a forest is clearly not an option to test the solutions, the crisis incident needs to be faked or simulated. The same applies to expected reactions of the environment: people panicking, traffic jams, etc. must be simulated too. As most <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cm" class="glossary-term" title="Crisis Management, a holistic management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten an organization and provides a framework for building resilience, with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of the organization&apos;s key interested parties, reputation, brand and value creating activities, as well as effectively restoring operational capabilities. Note to entry: Crisis management also involves the management of preparedness, mitigation, response, and continuity or recovery in the event of an incident, as well as management of the overall programme through training, rehearsals and reviews to ensure the preparedness, response and continuity plans stay current and up-to-date.">CM</a> simulators cannot simulate realistically all types of incident and reactions, the Test-bed supports multiple simulators so they can collaborate and create the desired fictitious incident.</li>
<li><strong>Solution support:</strong> The new and shiny <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cop" class="glossary-term" title="Common Operational Picture tools for creating a shared situational awareness">COP</a> tool or other solution that is being evaluated never acts standalone in a void. Normally, solutions need to exchange information with other (legacy) solutions too, which is also supported by the Test-bed.</li>
<li><strong>Development support:</strong> To connect new solutions and simulators to the Test-bed, the Test-bed provides adapters in several popular languages and several debugging tools and services. Also, to check whether everything is up-and-running smoothly, developers and system operators can use the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#admin-tool" class="glossary-term" title="The admin tool provides the technical administrator of the Test-bed with a overview of all the services that are running.">Admin tool</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Execution support:</strong> Scenarios created during the preparation phase can be &apos;executed&apos;, or played, in order to control the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>. And the scenario time is controllable too.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluation support:</strong> As we are testing and evaluating new solutions, the Test-bed provides the After-Action-Review tool for capturing and reviewing sent messages and the Observer Support tool to capture observations. In addition, the exchanged information can be logged and processed for further evaluation after the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>.</li>

<p>In the following sections, a use case (storyline) description of each is provided. The main actor in each story is Monica, a regional crisis manager with a professional background in fire-fighting. One of the challenges she is facing is that she does not always have a good overview of where her people and trucks are during a large-scale fire, and she is looking for a solution.

<li>She selects it in the menu (see Figure 6).</li>
<li>She understands that it is difficult to test a solution without any data / scenario, so she visits the data tab and selects a fire-fighting data set situated in the South of France: <em>It involves a large-scale forest fire, which is rapidly spreading. Ambulances and fire trucks are deployed and driving around. She can also look at census data of the area and a weather report.</em></li>

</li>
<li><p>After a brief moment, the Test-bed is running and she gets her own unique link. She visits this website, and is presented with a simple menu: she can start (pause | stop) the fire fighting scenario, and open the website of the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cop" class="glossary-term" title="Common Operational Picture tools for creating a shared situational awareness">COP</a> tool. <em>In its layer menu, she can turn on the layer which shows the ambulances and fire trucks.

<p>The above scenario still represents the ideal situation.

<h2 id="22-use-case-assessing-solutions-using-a-trial">2.2 Use Case: Assessing solutions using a Trial</h2>
<p>In order to run a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>, a similar process as described above could be followed. The main difference is that more services and solutions will be added, and more people are involved. In addition, the Test-bed is needed already well-before the final <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> date, since:</p>
<ul>
<li>The scenario is created iteratively.</li>
<li>Not all solutions or simulators are already able to connect to the Test-bed. So even before the first dry-runs, solutions and simulators should be able to test their connection and integration.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, Monica is supported by the local <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cm" class="glossary-term" title="Crisis Management, a holistic management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten an organization and provides a framework for building resilience, with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of the organization&apos;s key interested parties, reputation, brand and value creating activities, as well as effectively restoring operational capabilities.

<li>She contacts the solution provider, and informs him of her Test-bed.

This connection to the Test-bed is needed, so the Solution can receive information about a fictitious incident, or from other solutions in a more complex <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>.</li>
<li>As part of the online Test-bed, she now has access to the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>-Management-Tool Tool (<a href="GLOSSARY.html#tmt" class="glossary-term" title="The Trial-Management-Tool acts as the composer and conductor of a classical performance:">TMT</a>, see Chapter 3), formerly known as the Scenario Editor, which allows her or one of her colleagues, to create the outlines of several wildfire scenarios by recording the main flow of events during an incident. The scenario is key in that it translates specific objectives to a storyline so the solutions or people can be put to the test:</li>
<li>As the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#tmt" class="glossary-term" title="The Trial-Management-Tool acts as the composer and conductor of a classical performance:">TMT</a> does not create the actual incident itself, she realizes that she needs some simulators to simulate a wildfire, traffic and evacuating civilians. In DRIVER+&apos;s Portfolio of Solutions, she finds several simulators that are compatible with the Test-bed and contacts their owners. The simulation providers, like the solutions provider, are able to connect to Monica&apos;s Test-bed too. Alternatively, it may be offered by the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cm" class="glossary-term" title="Crisis Management, a holistic management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten an organization and provides a framework for building resilience, with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of the organization&apos;s key interested parties, reputation, brand and value creating activities, as well as effectively restoring operational capabilities.

Using the Test-bed connection, the simulators can send incident information to the connected Solution, which it can display. In addition, simulators can share information too, so simulated people do not walk happily through the fire!</li>
<li>Monica asks one of her colleagues to detail the questions for the observers, which he can document in the Observer Support Tool (<a href="GLOSSARY.html#ost" class="glossary-term" title="The online observer support tool facilitates the task of the observer by providing him or her with pre-made questions that can be easily answered during a Trial or exercise, and scenario triggers informing the observer of things to come. In addition, these responses will be harvested by the Test-bed, and used for evaluation at the end of the exercise.">OST</a>, see Chapter 3).</li>
<li>During a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>, Monica can start the scenario. The <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>-Management-Tool Tool instructs everyone when to perform their planned act. For example, the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#tmt" class="glossary-term" title="The Trial-Management-Tool acts as the composer and conductor of a classical performance:">TMT</a> instructs the Observer Support Tool to send the first set of questions to the observers. Monica can also control the scenario time, for example by freezing the time during a break. In case the users of a Solution missed an important test moment, she can also invoke optional storylines or acts, so the Solution and its users get another chance to prove itself.</li>
