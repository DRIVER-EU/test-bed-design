<p>In order to have a common understanding within the DRIVER+ project and beyond and to ensure the use of a common language in all project deliverables and communications, a terminology is developed by making reference to main sources, such as ISO standards and UNISDR. This terminology is presented online as part of the Portfolio of Solutions and it will be continuously reviewed and updated<sup><a href="#fn_1" id="reffn_1">1</a></sup>. The terminology is applied throughout the documents produced by DRIVER+. Each deliverable includes an annex as provided hereunder, which holds an extract from the comprehensive terminology containing the relevant DRIVER+ terms for this respective document.</p>
