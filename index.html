<p>The Test-bed reference implementation lies at the heart of the Trialling environment of the <a href="driver-project.eu">DRIVER+ project</a> (see Figure 1). It provides an open source technical backbone to perform Trials or exercises in a methodical and structured way by offering practitioners a suite of free <em>software</em> tools. This document discusses the Test-bed&apos;s usage and design, and therefore it is expected that the reader has at least some technical background. In DRIVER+ deliverable <a href="https://driver-eu.gitbooks.io/test-bed-specification" target="_blank">D923.11</a> &quot;Functional specification of the Test-bed&quot;, the requirements of the Test-bed are documented. These requirements serve as basis for the design of the first release of the DRIVER+ Test-bed reference implementation as described in this deliverable D923.21.</p>
<p>The <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="A Trial is a test of the performance, qualities, or suitability of a solution. A solution, in this context, is something that solves a crisis management gap.">trial</a>-oriented environment developed in sub-project 92 (Test-bed) of DRIVER+ is conceived and designed to allow systematic testing of solutions in realistic but non-operational contexts (namely, in Trials) to help practitioners in assessing solutions that can drive innovation (changes) before adopting them. See also deliverable D922.21, &quot;<a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="A Trial is a test of the performance, qualities, or suitability of a solution. A solution, in this context, is something that solves a crisis management gap.">Trial</a> guidance methodology and guidance tool specifications (version 1)&quot;.</p>
<p>The purpose of conducting Trials in DRIVER+ is to find out if and how some innovative solutions can help resolve the needs of Crisis Management practitioners.</p>
<figure id="fig1.2.1"><img src="img/pmte_paradigm.png" alt="PTME paradigm applied to DRIVER+"><figcaption>Figure 1. PTME paradigm applied to DRIVER+.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The basic problem that the Test-bed reference implementation tries to solve is how to connect different solutions, which solve a particular Crisis Management (<a href="GLOSSARY.html#cm" class="glossary-term" title="Crisis Management, a holistic management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten an organization and provides a framework for building resilience, with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of the organization&apos;s key interested parties, reputation, brand and value creating activities, as well as effectively restoring operational capabilities. Note to entry: Crisis management also involves the management of preparedness, mitigation, response, and continuity or recovery in the event of an incident, as well as management of the overall programme through training, rehearsals and reviews to ensure the preparedness, response and continuity plans stay current and up-to-date.">CM</a>) gap, to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Each other:</strong> since no single application can solve all <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cm" class="glossary-term" title="Crisis Management, a holistic management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten an organization and provides a framework for building resilience, with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of the organization&apos;s key interested parties, reputation, brand and value creating activities, as well as effectively restoring operational capabilities. Note to entry: Crisis management also involves the management of preparedness, mitigation, response, and continuity or recovery in the event of an incident, as well as management of the overall programme through training, rehearsals and reviews to ensure the preparedness, response and continuity plans stay current and up-to-date.">CM</a> gaps, they need to work together by sharing information.</li>
<li><strong>One or more simulators:</strong> since during a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="A Trial is a test of the performance, qualities, or suitability of a solution. A solution, in this context, is something that solves a crisis management gap.">Trial</a>, you cannot start a real incident, there needs to be a way to <em>simulate</em> a realistic incident.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main design decision is to connect solutions to a so-called Common Information Space (<a href="GLOSSARY.html#cis" class="glossary-term" title="Common Information Space for exchanging crisis management messages between solutions.">CIS</a>), simulators to a Common Simulation Space (<a href="GLOSSARY.html#css" class="glossary-term" title="Common Simulation Space for exchanging simulation data between simulators.">CSS</a>), and to have gateway services in between that selectively allow some information to pass between the two spaces (see Figure 2). These spaces can be public or private, and allow for applications to write messages to a topic of interest, or read those messages. Although both spaces are comparable in that they share well structured messages (using Apache <a href="GLOSSARY.html#avro" class="glossary-term" title="Open data serialization system supported by the Apache Organisation.">AVRO</a>) over a popular open source distributed messaging system, Apache Kafka, the separation allows for a better control of the message flow, and for replacing parts with an alternative implementations if needed.</p>
<p>In addition, several adapters are created to connect solutions and simulators to the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cis" class="glossary-term" title="Common Information Space for exchanging crisis management messages between solutions.">CIS</a> and <a href="GLOSSARY.html#css" class="glossary-term" title="Common Simulation Space for exchanging simulation data between simulators.">CSS</a>: besides allowing users of the Test-bed to choose an adapter in their favourite programming language, and share messages, it also provides a common interface for configuration, heartbeat messages, and security. Currently, adapters in Java, C#, JavaScript/TypeScript and <a href="GLOSSARY.html#rest" class="glossary-term" title="REpresentational State Transfer, is a way to interact with many web services, thereby providing interoperability between computer systems on the Internet.">REST</a> are available, and a Python adapter is planned for the next release.</p>
<figure id="fig1.2.2"><img src="img/test_bed_overview_cis_css.png" alt="CIS and CSS"><figcaption>Figure 2. <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cis" class="glossary-term" title="Common Information Space for exchanging crisis management messages between solutions.">CIS</a> and <a href="GLOSSARY.html#css" class="glossary-term" title="Common Simulation Space for exchanging simulation data between simulators.">CSS</a>.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Around this core functionality, additional tools are developed that facilitate the usage of this environment (see Figure 3):</p>
<ul>
<li>Administrative tools: Is everyone up-and-running, secure, and connected to the right information topics?</li>
<li>Evaluation tools: What did we observe during the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="A Trial is a test of the performance, qualities, or suitability of a solution. A solution, in this context, is something that solves a crisis management gap.">Trial</a>, and what implications does this have during the After-Action Review.</li>
<li>Scenario tools: To create an interesting scenario that triggers the participants and solutions in the right way.</li>
<li>Support tools: For testing and debugging, for creating your personalized Test-bed environment, but also to share common data such as map layers or census data.</li>
</ul>
<figure id="fig1.2.3"><img src="img/test-bed-components-explained.png" alt="Test-bed reference implementation"><figcaption>Figure 3. Test-bed reference implementation.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Test-bed will be delivered in 3 versions. Version 1 is intended for use in Trials 1 and 2, and consists of a limited number of components (i.e. <a href="GLOSSARY.html#scenario-manager" class="glossary-term" title="The Scenario Manager acts as the composer and conductor of a classical performance:">Scenario Manager</a> and <a href="GLOSSARY.html#aar" class="glossary-term" title="The After-Action Review (AAR) tool provides the possibility to collect data after a Trial has finished and analyse it. Its main purpose is to facilitate the evaluation of the trialled solutions against the predefined objectives, and to help the participants determine how well they functioned. It collects messages (exchanged during Trial), observation reports and takes screen-shots of the applications during their use.">AAR</a> not included and other components in first prototype quality). Version 2 is to be used in Trials 3 and 4 and the Final Demo and comes with all components with a quality level surpassing that of a first prototype. It should contain data-sets and basic scenarios that can be used for effectively implementing and testing the Test-bed. The final version, Version 3, should have an even better quality based on experiences gathered from the use of the Test-bed in the executed Trials. All versions are already available open-source (under a liberal MIT license) on <a href="https://github.com/DRIVER-EU" target="_blank">github.com/DRIVER-EU</a>.
The subsequent updated Test-bed reference implementations are documented in D923.21, D923.22 and D923.23 - Reference Implementations of the Test-bed (versions 1/2/3 resp.).</p>
