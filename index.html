<p>The Test-bed reference implementation lies at the heart of the Trialling environment of the <a href="driver-project.eu">DRIVER+ project</a> (see Figure 1 or visit the animation online at <a href="https://vimeo.com/299680658" target="_blank">https://vimeo.com/299680658</a>). It provides an open source technical backbone to perform Trials or exercises in a methodical and structured way by offering Crisis Management practitioners a suite of free and open source <em>software</em> tools. This document discusses the Test-bed&apos;s usage and design from the perspective of a practitioner. The later chapters, however, are aimed at developers and system administrators, and therefore assume that the reader has at least some technical background. In the DRIVER+ deliverable <a href="https://driver-eu.gitbooks.io/test-bed-specification" target="_blank">D923.11</a> &quot;Functional specification of the Test-bed&quot;, the requirements of the Test-bed are documented. These requirements serve as basis for the design of the first release of the DRIVER+ Test-bed reference implementation as described in deliverable <a href="https://www.driver-project.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DRIVERPLUS_D923.21_First-release-of-the-Test-bed-reference-implementation.pdf" target="_blank">D923.21</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The current version of this document discusses the <strong>third version</strong> of the Test-bed reference implementation. Therefore, all returning readers are advised to read the <a href="changes.html">change history</a> carefully, as many parts of this document did not change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">trial</a>-oriented environment developed in sub-project 92 (Test-bed) of DRIVER+ is conceived and designed to allow systematic testing of solutions in realistic but non-operational contexts (namely, in Trials) to help practitioners in assessing solutions that can drive innovation (changes) before adopting them. See also deliverable <a href="https://www.driver-project.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DRIVERPLUS_D922.21_Trial-guidance-methodology-and-guidance-tool-specifications.pdf" target="_blank">D922.21, &quot;Trial guidance methodology (TGM) and guidance tool specifications (version 1)</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>The purpose of conducting Trials in DRIVER+ is to find out if and how some innovative solutions can help resolve the needs of Crisis Management practitioners.</p>
<figure id="fig1.2.1"><img src="img/pmte_paradigm.png" alt="Process-Methods-Tools-Environment (PMTE) paradigm, where the TGM prescribes the Process and Methodology, supported by the Test-bed technical infrastructure (Tools)."><figcaption>Figure 1. Process-Methods-Tools-Environment (PMTE) paradigm, where the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#tgm" class="glossary-term" title="Trial Guidance Methodology, see also DRIVER+ deliverable D922.21 - Trial guidance methodology and guidance tool specifications (version 1).">TGM</a> prescribes the Process and Methodology, supported by the Test-bed technical infrastructure (Tools)..</figcaption></figure>
<p>The basic problem that the Test-bed reference implementation tries to solve is how to connect different solutions, which solve a particular Crisis Management (<a href="GLOSSARY.html#cm" class="glossary-term" title="Crisis Management, a holistic management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten an organization and provides a framework for building resilience, with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of the organization&apos;s key interested parties, reputation, brand and value creating activities, as well as effectively restoring operational capabilities. Note to entry: Crisis management also involves the management of preparedness, mitigation, response, and continuity or recovery in the event of an incident, as well as management of the overall programme through training, rehearsals and reviews to ensure the preparedness, response and continuity plans stay current and up-to-date.">CM</a>) gap, to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Each other:</strong> since no single application can solve all <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cm" class="glossary-term" title="Crisis Management, a holistic management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten an organization and provides a framework for building resilience, with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of the organization&apos;s key interested parties, reputation, brand and value creating activities, as well as effectively restoring operational capabilities. Note to entry: Crisis management also involves the management of preparedness, mitigation, response, and continuity or recovery in the event of an incident, as well as management of the overall programme through training, rehearsals and reviews to ensure the preparedness, response and continuity plans stay current and up-to-date.">CM</a> gaps, they need to work together by sharing information.</li>
<li><strong>One or more simulators:</strong> since during a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>, you cannot start a real incident, there needs to be a way to <em>simulate</em> a realistic incident.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main design decision is to connect solutions to a so-called Common Information Space (<a href="GLOSSARY.html#cis" class="glossary-term" title="Common Information Space for exchanging crisis management messages between solutions.">CIS</a>), simulators to a Common Simulation Space (<a href="GLOSSARY.html#css" class="glossary-term" title="Common Simulation Space for exchanging simulation data between simulators.">CSS</a>), and to have gateway services in between that selectively allow some information to pass between the two spaces (see Figure 2). These spaces can be public or private, and allow applications to write messages to a topic of interest, or read those messages. Although both spaces are comparable in that they share well structured messages (using Apache <a href="GLOSSARY.html#avro" class="glossary-term" title="Open data serialization system supported by the Apache Organisation.">AVRO</a>) over a popular open source distributed messaging system, Apache Kafka, the separation allows for a better control of the message flow, and for replacing parts with an alternative implementation if needed.</p>
<p>In addition, several adapters are created to connect solutions and simulators to the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cis" class="glossary-term" title="Common Information Space for exchanging crisis management messages between solutions.">CIS</a> and <a href="GLOSSARY.html#css" class="glossary-term" title="Common Simulation Space for exchanging simulation data between simulators.">CSS</a>: besides allowing users of the Test-bed to choose an adapter in their favourite programming language, and share messages, it also provides a common interface for configuration, heartbeat messages, and security. Currently, adapters in Java, C#, JavaScript/TypeScript/NodeJS, Python and <a href="GLOSSARY.html#rest" class="glossary-term" title="REpresentational State Transfer, is a way to interact with many web services, thereby providing interoperability between computer systems on the Internet.">REST</a> are available.</p>
<figure id="fig1.2.2"><img src="img/test_bed_overview_cis_css.png" alt="The Common Information and Simulation Space allow the exchange of well-structured, informative messages"><figcaption>Figure 2. The Common Information and Simulation Space allow the exchange of well-structured, informative messages.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Around this core functionality, additional tools are developed that facilitate the usage of this environment (see Figure 3):</p>
<ul>
<li>Administrative tools: Is everyone up-and-running, secure, and connected to the right information topics?</li>
<li>Evaluation tools: What did we observe during the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>, and what implications does this have during the After-Action-Review.</li>
<li>Scenario tools: To create an interesting scenario that triggers the participants and solutions in the right way.</li>
<li>Support tools: For testing and debugging, for creating your personalized Test-bed environment, but also to share common data such as map layers or census data.</li>
</ul>

Test-bed reference implementation: the components inside the yellow rectangle are being developed as open source tools in the DRIVER+ project.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Test-bed will be delivered in 3 versions. Version 1 is intended for use in Trials 1 and 2, and consists of a limited number of components (i.e. <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>-Management-Tool (<a href="GLOSSARY.html#tmt" class="glossary-term" title="The Trial-Management-Tool acts as the composer and conductor of a classical performance:">TMT</a>) and After-Action-Review (<a href="GLOSSARY.html#aar" class="glossary-term" title="The After-Action-Review (AAR) tool provides the possibility to collect data after a Trial has finished and analyse it. Its main purpose is to facilitate the evaluation of the trialled solutions against the predefined objectives, and to help the participants determine how well they functioned. It collects messages (exchanged during Trial), observation reports and takes screen-shots of the applications during their use.">AAR</a>) tool are not included and other components in first prototype quality). Version 2 was used in <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> 4 with a first version of the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#tmt" class="glossary-term" title="The Trial-Management-Tool acts as the composer and conductor of a classical performance:">TMT</a> and <a href="GLOSSARY.html#aar" class="glossary-term" title="The After-Action-Review (AAR) tool provides the possibility to collect data after a Trial has finished and analyse it.

<p>All software is already available open-source (under a liberal MIT license) on <a href="https://github.com/DRIVER-EU" target="_blank">github.com/DRIVER-EU</a>. The subsequent updated Test-bed reference implementations are documented in D923.21, D923.22, and D923.23 (this document) - Reference Implementations of the Test-bed (versions 1/2/3 resp.).</p>
<p>Besides the officially released software components, as described in the DRIVER+ DoW and in this document, the DRIVER-EU space on GitHub also contains many other useful services that were developed in order to support a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>&apos;s specific needs. For example, <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> 4 required a deep integration between the Test-bed and the Dutch Crisis Management System (LCMS). This has led to a connector that extracts text and map overlays and vice versa. This connector is also being used in an upcoming table-top <a href="GLOSSARY.html#exercise" class="glossary-term" title="An exercise is an activity carried out to train personnel and processes in crisis management.">exercise</a> (organised by the EU project IN-PREP) that is situated in The Netherlands, and will be supported in the future by the Dutch national <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cm" class="glossary-term" title="Crisis Management, a holistic management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten an organization and provides a framework for building resilience, with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of the organization&apos;s key interested parties, reputation, brand and value creating activities, as well as effectively restoring operational capabilities. Note to entry: Crisis management also involves the management of preparedness, mitigation, response, and continuity or recovery in the event of an incident, as well as management of the overall programme through training, rehearsals and reviews to ensure the preparedness, response and continuity plans stay current and up-to-date.">CM</a> CoE, IFV. Or on the simulator side, a connector with the open source SUMO traffic simulator was created, so future trials or exercises can operate against a realistic traffic background, or use it for dispatching virtual ambulances. Other examples include the lesson&apos;s learned framework website, an icon and large file service, a geo-server that triggers when people or entities are at a certain location, an email gateway to add email services to the Test-bed, a Twitter service that sends messages to (preferably a private) twitter account, to name but a few. This document, however, focuses on the main deliverables needed to setup a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>.</p>
