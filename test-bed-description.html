<p>The Test-bed supports practitioners by providing an environment in which they can easily <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> new solutions and run exercises. In this chapter, the main components of the Test-bed are explained (see <a href="./#fig1.2.3">Figure 3</a>) and is aimed at a fairly technical audience. A shorter version was recently presented at ITEC2019, &quot;An interoperability Framework for Trials and Exercises&quot;, by Hendriks, Vullings, Van Campen2, and Hameete.</p>
<p>Although most trialled DRIVER+ solutions are software systems, the Test-bed also offers excellent support for non-software systems, such as a new process or procedure.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Test-bed&apos;s technical infrastructure can be used to put a new process in a relevant crisis-management context. For example, the open source <a href="http://sumo.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">SUMO tool</a> could be used to simulate traffic, and the open source <a href="https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/csCOP" target="_blank">csCOP tool</a> could be used to offer the participants a realistic common operational picture during their <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>. There are also organisations that provide commercial support to provide the Test-bed with realistic incident visualisations.</li>
<li>Within the Test-bed, there are three tools that can also be of direct value for trialling new procedures: the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>-Management-Tool (<a href="test-bed-description.html#trial-management-tool">see Section 3.3</a>), the Observer-Support-Tool (<a href="test-bed-description.html#online-observer-support-tool">Section 3.4</a>), and the After-Action-Review tool (<a href="test-bed-description.html#after-action-review-tool">Section 3.4</a>). The first to provide stimuli to the procedure, the second to capture all observations, and the last to review the whole <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">trial</a> session.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="31-core">3.1 Core</h2>
<p>The Test-bed must support the exchange of information between solutions, simulators and tools. Information such as the location of an incident, alert messages, or the locations of vehicles. Comparable to people exchanging information via email, chat or twitter, the Test-bed exchanges information using the open-source messaging system <a href="https://kafka.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Kafka</a> from the <a href="http://www.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache organisation</a>. These messages can have different effects, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display a message to an end-user such as an email or an alert on a map.</li>
<li>Track the location of your own people on a map.</li>
<li>Share the current situational status between <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cm" class="glossary-term" title="Crisis Management, a holistic management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten an organization and provides a framework for building resilience, with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of the organization&apos;s key interested parties, reputation, brand and value creating activities, as well as effectively restoring operational capabilities.

<li>Dispatch an ambulance to the incident location.</li>
<li>Receive an update of the wildfire location from the drone system.</li>
<li>Trigger a flooding simulator to send a new flood map.</li>
<li>Make part of the road network inaccessible for traffic.</li>
<li>Sharing an observation made by an observer, which can be used as input to the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cm" class="glossary-term" title="Crisis Management, a holistic management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten an organization and provides a framework for building resilience, with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of the organization&apos;s key interested parties, reputation, brand and value creating activities, as well as effectively restoring operational capabilities.

<li>Send a message to a role-player, who subsequently makes a call as a concerned citizen to the crisis communication centre.</li>
<li>Mark the begin or end of a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cm" class="glossary-term" title="Crisis Management, a holistic management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten an organization and provides a framework for building resilience, with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of the organization&apos;s key interested parties, reputation, brand and value creating activities, as well as effectively restoring operational capabilities.

</ul>
<p>Although already many messages are implemented, it is easy to add more, based on the needs of the actual <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>.</p>
<p>Each message is published in a so-called <em>topic</em>, where each topic can only be used for one type of message. To receive these messages, all an application needs to do is to subscribe to the topic of interest, using an adapter.</p>
<h3 id="adapters">Adapters</h3>
<p>Adapters are used to connect solutions and simulators to the Test-bed in order to exchange information. As the Test-bed is based on Apache Kafka, which is used worldwide, there are connectors for most programming languages, so software applications can easily connect to it. While connected to the Test-bed, an application can send and/or receive messages. When you want to <em>receive</em> a message, you subscribe to a topic of interest: thereafter, you get all the messages that are published until you end your subscription. Optionally, you can even receive messages that were published in the past, or while you were offline, as Kafka logs all messages for a configurable time. This is especially useful for mobile services that are not always connected to a network. To <em>publish</em> a message, you just need to send it to a topic of interest and every interested application that has subscribed to this topic receives it instantly.</p>
<p><em>For example, to publish a CAP (Common Alerting Protocol) message to all interested parties, you use an adapter to send your CAP message to the &apos;cap&apos; topic. Every tool that has subscribed to the &apos;cap&apos; topic will get it right away.</em></p>
<p>The default Kafka connectors, however, are lacking certain features that are useful in a Test-bed environment, so several existing connectors have been extended. These extended connectors are called <strong>adapters</strong>, which extend regular Kafka connectors with:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Heartbeat signals:</em> Before you can start a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>, every solution, simulator and tool needs to be up-and-running. Therefore every adapter transmits a heartbeat signal every 5 seconds to inform others it is online. This is monitored in the <a href="#22-test-bed-administration-tool">Admin Tool</a>.</li>
<li><em>Logging:</em> Besides being online, it is also important to know that each connected service is running as expected, so each adapter offers the option to log warnings/errors to the Test-bed as well. The logs are also displayed in the <a href="#22-test-bed-administration-tool">Admin Tool</a>.</li>
<li><em>Configuration options:</em> The adapter can be instructed via the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#admin-tool" class="glossary-term" title="The admin tool provides the technical administrator of the Test-bed with a overview of all the services that are running.">Admin tool</a> to subscribe and publish to certain topics. Alternatively, in development mode, the adapters are free to connect to any topic.</li>
<li><em><a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> Time:</em> A <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> scenario typically will not run at real-time, so the adapter needs to share the fictive simulation time. In addition, it shares the simulation speed, as we may be running slower or faster than real-time, as well as the simulation state (paused/playing/stopped).</li>
<li><em>Large files:</em> Although most messages that are shared between applications are small (&lt; 1Mb), some are not. For example, to describe the flooding in an area, or when capturing drone imagery, file sizes may easily exceed 1Gb. For that reason, the Test-bed runs a service to share large files, and adapters facilitate using this service: the large file is uploaded to the service, and the adapter either sends a message when ready, or informs the application. Other applications can subsequently use the returned (URL) address to access the file.</li>
<li><em>Security:</em> By default, all topics are accessible to all connected adapters, which is fine in most cases. However, sometimes a less liberal access is required, e.g. when sharing the locations of critical infrastructure or network configurations. All adapters, therefore, include a security component which prevents unauthorized users from accessing specified topics.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Test-bed currently maintains the following adapters: <a href="https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/java-test-bed-adapter" target="_blank">Java</a>, <a href="https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/csharp-test-bed-adapter" target="_blank">C#</a>, <a href="https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/node-test-bed-adapter" target="_blank">JavaScript/TypeScript/Node.js</a>, <a href="https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/python-test-bed-adapter" target="_blank">Python</a>, and a <a href="https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/test-bed-rest-service" target="_blank">REST</a> adapter, which allows any application to publish and receive messages using basic internet commands.</p>
<h3 id="avro-message-types">AVRO Message types</h3>
<p>As software applications need to understand the messages they receive, the Test-bed has to assure that every message that is sent complies with the expected format (syntax). For example, when a solution wants to share the location of a vehicle or the value of a sensor, you probably need to capture the vehicle&apos;s or sensor&apos;s location, as well as its type, speed or sensor value. Then it is important to know that the type will be one out of a list of possibilities, that the location is specified using two numbers, and that the speed or sensor value is a number too.</p>
<p>To capture this information, the common solution is to specify it in a so-called schema. The Test-bed enforces this too, and it uses the open <a href="https://avro.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache AVRO</a> schema format (for a brief example, see below). All Test-bed schema&apos;s are shared publicly in the <a href="https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/avro-schemas" target="_blank">DRIVER+ AVRO schema repository</a>, which also contains more relevant schema&apos;s for CAP or EMSI messages. An excerpt of a CAP schema is shown below.</p>

<p><strong>Dealing with standards:</strong> In the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cm" class="glossary-term" title="Crisis Management, a holistic management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten an organization and provides a framework for building resilience, with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of the organization&apos;s key interested parties, reputation, brand and value creating activities, as well as effectively restoring operational capabilities. Note to entry: Crisis management also involves the management of preparedness, mitigation, response, and continuity or recovery in the event of an incident, as well as management of the overall programme through training, rehearsals and reviews to ensure the preparedness, response and continuity plans stay current and up-to-date.">CM</a> domain, several standards exists, such as CAP, EDXL or EMSI. They are represented using XML, a textual representation of a message that is easily readable by computers, and which are formalized using XML schemas. Although the Test-bed could have used XML messages directly, there is currently no way to validate this inside Kafka, i.e. a topic that should only deal with CAP messages would still accept EMSI messages, since they are both XML, which would lead to exceptions in the topic subscribers. Even trickier are invalid CAP messages that do not respect the XML schema, or use a different version of the schema. Also XML messages are much more verbose than the binary <a href="GLOSSARY.html#avro" class="glossary-term" title="Open data serialization system supported by the Apache Organisation.">AVRO</a> messages.</p>
<p>For all of these reasons, the Test-bed enforces all topics to use <a href="GLOSSARY.html#avro" class="glossary-term" title="Open data serialization system supported by the Apache Organisation.">AVRO</a> schemas, and the XML schemas are converted to <a href="GLOSSARY.html#avro" class="glossary-term" title="Open data serialization system supported by the Apache Organisation.">AVRO</a> schemas. But this comes at a small price, as this conversion is not perfect since XML schemas are slightly more expressive. For example, an XML schema can enforce a string to adhere to a specific pattern, such as a phone number, which is not possible in <a href="GLOSSARY.html#avro" class="glossary-term" title="Open data serialization system supported by the Apache Organisation.">AVRO</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">xsd:simpleType</span> <span class="hljs-attr">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;phoneType&quot;</span>&gt;</span>

<p>However, since most solutions dealing with <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cm" class="glossary-term" title="Crisis Management, a holistic management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten an organization and provides a framework for building resilience, with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of the organization&apos;s key interested parties, reputation, brand and value creating activities, as well as effectively restoring operational capabilities.

Within the DRIVER+ Trials, at least, it worked well.</p>
<p>Finally, another advantage of using <a href="GLOSSARY.html#avro" class="glossary-term" title="Open data serialization system supported by the Apache Organisation.">AVRO</a> schemas is that they are shared in the Test-bed via the schema registry</p>
<h3 id="cis-and-css">CIS and CSS</h3>
<p>The Test-bed distinguishes between a Common Information Space (<a href="GLOSSARY.html#cis" class="glossary-term" title="Common Information Space for exchanging crisis management messages between solutions.">CIS</a>) and a Common Simulation Space (<a href="GLOSSARY.html#css" class="glossary-term" title="Common Simulation Space for exchanging simulation data between simulators.">CSS</a>). The <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cis" class="glossary-term" title="Common Information Space for exchanging crisis management messages between solutions.">CIS</a> is where <em>solutions</em> exchange information, typically based on current emergency standards such as the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP), or Emergency Data Exchange Language (EDXL). The <a href="GLOSSARY.html#css" class="glossary-term" title="Common Simulation Space for exchanging simulation data between simulators.">CSS</a> is for <em>simulators</em> to exchange information. Typically, the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cis" class="glossary-term" title="Common Information Space for exchanging crisis management messages between solutions.">CIS</a> will exchange far fewer messages during a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>, and time synchronisation is simple. In the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#css" class="glossary-term" title="Common Simulation Space for exchanging simulation data between simulators.">CSS</a>, however, many more messages are generated, e.g. the location of all vehicles may be updated every second. Simulators often need to be in tight synchronization with each other, e.g. when a flooding simulator floods an area, the traffic simulator should divert its traffic, and in the crowd simulator, people may be drowning.</p>
<p>For simple Trials, the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#css" class="glossary-term" title="Common Simulation Space for exchanging simulation data between simulators.">CSS</a> and <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cis" class="glossary-term" title="Common Information Space for exchanging crisis management messages between solutions.">CIS</a> will run in the same Test-bed. In case performance suffers, it may be necessary to split the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#css" class="glossary-term" title="Common Simulation Space for exchanging simulation data between simulators.">CSS</a> and <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cis" class="glossary-term" title="Common Information Space for exchanging crisis management messages between solutions.">CIS</a> over two Test-beds that are interconnected, a feature that Apache Kafka supports out-of-the-box.</p>
<p>Note, though, that the <a href="#adapters">adapters</a> can be used to connect to the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cis" class="glossary-term" title="Common Information Space for exchanging crisis management messages between solutions.">CIS</a> as well as the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#css" class="glossary-term" title="Common Simulation Space for exchanging simulation data between simulators.">CSS</a>, so there is no difference between them.</p>
<p>In rare cases, the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#css" class="glossary-term" title="Common Simulation Space for exchanging simulation data between simulators.">CSS</a> may be replaced, or extended, by one of the existing simulation standards such as <a href="GLOSSARY.html#hla" class="glossary-term" title="The high-level architecture (HLA) is a general purpose architecture for distributed computer simulation systems. Using HLA, computer simulations can interact (that is, to communicate data, and to synchronize actions) with other computer simulations regardless of the computing platforms. The interaction between simulations is managed by a run-time infrastructure (RTI). HLA is an interoperability standard for distributed simulation used to support analysis, engineering and training in a number of different domains in both military and civilian applications and is the standard technical architecture for all US Department of Defence simulations.">HLA</a> or <a href="GLOSSARY.html#dis" class="glossary-term" title="Distributed Interactive Simulation, a simulation standard en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Interactive_Simulation.">DIS</a>, that are especially popular in the Defence sector.

<h3 id="gateways-and-validation-services">Gateways and Validation Services</h3>
<p>Even when using well defined messages based on <a href="https://avro.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache AVRO</a>, it is certain that not all solutions and simulators speak each other&apos;s &apos;language&apos;. As in Europe, where not everyone is speaking Esperanto or English, there is a need for translators, in the Test-bed we need <em>gateways</em> to translate one topic&apos;s message to another. Examples are not only translating one message format to another, but for example to translate:</p>
<ul>
<li>A message from a simulator sharing the location of all vehicles in the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#css" class="glossary-term" title="Common Simulation Space for exchanging simulation data between simulators.">CSS</a>, to a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cop" class="glossary-term" title="Common Operational Picture tools for creating a shared situational awareness">COP</a> tool message in the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cis" class="glossary-term" title="Common Information Space for exchanging crisis management messages between solutions.">CIS</a> that only contains the location of its own resources.</li>
<li>An EDXL Resource Management request from a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cop" class="glossary-term" title="Common Operational Picture tools for creating a shared situational awareness">COP</a> tool in the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cis" class="glossary-term" title="Common Information Space for exchanging crisis management messages between solutions.">CIS</a> to a simulator message in the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#css" class="glossary-term" title="Common Simulation Space for exchanging simulation data between simulators.">CSS</a>, which in turn sends out an ambulance to the required location.</li>
<li>A flood map as generated by the flooding simulator containing the actually flooded area, to a flood map based on the available sensor information containing the realistically known flooded area.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to facilitate Solutions to obtain the needed information from the simulated world, the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#css" class="glossary-term" title="Common Simulation Space for exchanging simulation data between simulators.">CSS</a> needs to be connected with the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cis" class="glossary-term" title="Common Information Space for exchanging crisis management messages between solutions.">CIS</a> by means of translator applications, residing in the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cis" class="glossary-term" title="Common Information Space for exchanging crisis management messages between solutions.">CIS</a>-<a href="GLOSSARY.html#css" class="glossary-term" title="Common Simulation Space for exchanging simulation data between simulators.">CSS</a> Gateway (see Figure 8). These translator applications form the bridge between the simulated <em>truth</em> in the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#css" class="glossary-term" title="Common Simulation Space for exchanging simulation data between simulators.">CSS</a>, where everything is known, and the <em>perceived truth</em> in the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cis" class="glossary-term" title="Common Information Space for exchanging crisis management messages between solutions.">CIS</a> by translating relevant changes from the simulated world to messages globally understood in the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cis" class="glossary-term" title="Common Information Space for exchanging crisis management messages between solutions.">CIS</a>.</p>
<figure id="fig1.5.1"><img src="img/conceptual-diagram-of-gateways.png" alt="Conceptual diagram of gateways translating messages back and forth between CIS and CSS"><figcaption>Figure 8. Conceptual diagram of gateways translating messages back and forth between <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cis" class="glossary-term" title="Common Information Space for exchanging crisis management messages between solutions.">CIS</a> and <a href="GLOSSARY.html#css" class="glossary-term" title="Common Simulation Space for exchanging simulation data between simulators.">CSS</a>.</figcaption></figure>
<blockquote>
<p>An example of this would be the simulation of a flooding. Imagine a river that has rising water levels due to an increase of rain water. At the river bank, there are several sensors that measure the actual water level. An application is created and connected to current operational systems to send CAP messages regarding the water level in clear categories ranging from LOW to DANGEROUSLY HIGH. A possible solution is assessed on improving decision-making based on the messages outputted by the created sensor application.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this example, the water level is calculated in a flooding simulator, which connects to the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#css" class="glossary-term" title="Common Simulation Space for exchanging simulation data between simulators.">CSS</a>. The gateway listens to the calculated water levels in the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#css" class="glossary-term" title="Common Simulation Space for exchanging simulation data between simulators.">CSS</a>, uses it to compute the water levels at the exact sensor locations, and sends out the expected messages to the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cis" class="glossary-term" title="Common Information Space for exchanging crisis management messages between solutions.">CIS</a>, similar to the operational application. The decision-support tool, which is connected to the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cis" class="glossary-term" title="Common Information Space for exchanging crisis management messages between solutions.">CIS</a>, listens to these formatted messages of the gateway as if it was connected to the actual operational application. This also provides <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> owners the option to experiment with sensor failures, more or fewer sensors, etc.</p>
<p>There are also Solutions that send messages which serve as commands or requests to change the simulated world. Again, a gateway would be used to bridge the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cis" class="glossary-term" title="Common Information Space for exchanging crisis management messages between solutions.">CIS</a> and <a href="GLOSSARY.html#css" class="glossary-term" title="Common Simulation Space for exchanging simulation data between simulators.">CSS</a> spaces.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, a new dispatch centre Solution allows users to send out emergency services from their dispatch towards the incident location. The Solution would send out a standard resource management message via the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cis" class="glossary-term" title="Common Information Space for exchanging crisis management messages between solutions.">CIS</a>. The gateway service picks up the message and translates it to a request for changing the simulation space. The responsible simulator would receive this request via the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#css" class="glossary-term" title="Common Simulation Space for exchanging simulation data between simulators.">CSS</a> and simulate an ambulance driving through the simulated world towards the incident location.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Validation Services</strong> are specific gateways that, as the name suggests, validate a message in more detail, before it is passed on to other systems. For example, if application A is publishing a CAP (Common Alerting Protocol) message for application B, i.e. A &#x2192; CAP topic &#x2192; B, the Test-bed will make sure that it complies with the appropriate schema before passing it on. However, there may still be certain aspects in the message that are not completely correct, e.g. the alerting area that is represented as a polygon may not have the same starting and ending point (i.e. it is not <em>closed</em>), or the incident location that is represented by two numbers (x, y), may actually be published as (y, x). So during testing, the validation service can &apos;intercept&apos; messages between A and B and validate them in detail. Only valid messages are passed on, i.e. A &#x2192; CAP validation topic &#x2192; CAP topic &#x2192; B.</p>
<h2 id="32-test-bed-administration-tool">3.2 Test-bed administration tool</h2>
<p>The Test-bed is a collection of services, simulators and solutions running in a distributed network environment, so it is  difficult to understand what is going on exactly. At the same time, the Test-bed needs to be prepared before the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> can take place. You can compare it to a theatre play, where the stage needs to be prepared, the actors and musicians must be ready, as well as the light and sound engineers. The Test-bed administration tool, or <a href="GLOSSARY.html#admin-tool" class="glossary-term" title="The admin tool provides the technical administrator of the Test-bed with a overview of all the services that are running.">admin tool</a> (see Figure 9) helps you set the stage, monitors both the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cis" class="glossary-term" title="Common Information Space for exchanging crisis management messages between solutions.">CIS</a> and the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#css" class="glossary-term" title="Common Simulation Space for exchanging simulation data between simulators.">CSS</a> to better understand the status of all services, simulators and Solutions.

<h3 id="tmt_reqts">Scenario support during a Trial or exercise </h3>
<p>A <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> or <a href="GLOSSARY.html#exercise" class="glossary-term" title="An exercise is an activity carried out to train personnel and processes in crisis management.">exercise</a> requires a relevant context for the participants in which they can <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">trial</a> new solutions or improve their competencies in handling an incident. This context is not static, but evolves in time, and may contain the incident but also non-participating organisations, and is called a <em>scenario</em>. For example, there is a storm, high waters and heavy rainfall, increasing the risk of flooding. Due to a traffic incident involving a truck, the gates of the main sluice cannot be closed anymore, and the water is threatening the inner city. Two hours later, a small dyke leakage floods an electricity station, rendering the pump to keep the polder dry useless. Etc.</p>
<p>In the simplest cases, such a scenario can be controlled via info cards, and at each step, a new info card message is presented to the participants. Such a message could detail an evolving situation, or inform them of a specific need, to name but a few. This quickly becomes unwieldy when dealing with many messages, or with alternative <em>what if</em> branches, and a tool would be needed to support the staff. A few tools exist to manage and support a scenario, which will be discussed in the next session. Ideally, such a tool should offer support to <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> staff for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creating and editing a new scenario, where a scenario is represented as a sequence of specific messages over time. These messages are often called <em>&apos;injects&apos;</em>, as they inject certain behaviour into a running <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>.</li>
<li>Providing a good overview of the scenario timeline: <em>what is happening when</em>.</li>

<li>Managing the requested observations: since a scenario defines what is happening when, it also &apos;knows&apos; best what should be observed, and should be able to inform observers to look out for certain behaviour.</li>

<h3 id="existing-software-for-managing-trials-or-exercises">Existing software for managing Trials or exercises</h3>
<p>In NATO, military exercises are often supported by the Joint <a href="GLOSSARY.html#exercise" class="glossary-term" title="An exercise is an activity carried out to train personnel and processes in crisis management.">Exercise</a> Management Module, or <a href="http://slideplayer.com/slide/7873364" target="_blank">JEMM</a> (see Figure 10). It is a web-based tool to support live exercises as well as table-top exercises, from a few people to battalions. Essentially, it is an enhanced spreadsheet, where each line represents an action, and the time moves down vertically, making it difficult to separate multiple storylines or see the whole picture. It also puts a lot of emphasis on authorization management (<em>who can do what?</em>) during the creation of a scenario, and has a limited level of automation: for example, the Command Staff Trainer of the Dutch Army employs a dedicated simulator to simulate the outcomes of a battle. This simulator is controlled manually, however, and JEMM is only used to inform a human operator when he or she has to take a particular action.</p>
<p>Since JEMM is only available to military NATO members, in which case it is free-of-charge, to use it in a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> would require military involvement.</p>

<p>Alternative commercial solutions exist too, such as <a href="https://www.4cstrategies.com/exonaut-products/training-and-exercise-manager" target="_blank">Exonaut</a> (see Figure 11). They also focus on a military audience, and follow a similar approach.</p>

<p>To properly support the complex Trials in DRIVER+, tooling is required for managing the scenario. However, it is not possible to use JEMM or Exonaut directly, as:</p>
<ul>
<li>JEMM is only available to NATO members, and can only be used in an <a href="GLOSSARY.html#exercise" class="glossary-term" title="An exercise is an activity carried out to train personnel and processes in crisis management.">exercise</a> when military personnel requests it.

Next, one or more appropriate <em>scenarios</em> are formulated by <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cm" class="glossary-term" title="Crisis Management, a holistic management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten an organization and provides a framework for building resilience, with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of the organization&apos;s key interested parties, reputation, brand and value creating activities, as well as effectively restoring operational capabilities.

The scenario is further broken down into <em>storylines</em>. A storyline describes a developing situation that trigger a trialled solution or will set conditions and provide the training audience an opportunity to achieve specific training objectives. It often targets a subset of the solutions or training audiences, e.g. only the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cop" class="glossary-term" title="Common Operational Picture tools for creating a shared situational awareness">COP</a> tool or fire fighters, and consists of timed events, or so-called <em>injects</em>. Think of an email to the commander, a &apos;start flooding&apos; message to a flooding simulator, or instructions to a role-playing actor. Additionally, the scenario may include extra messages for managing the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>, such as the time that a scenario was started or stopped (a session), instructing the observers to pay attention to certain behaviour, or annotation the begin and end of a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cm" class="glossary-term" title="Crisis Management, a holistic management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten an organization and provides a framework for building resilience, with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of the organization&apos;s key interested parties, reputation, brand and value creating activities, as well as effectively restoring operational capabilities.

<p>During the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> execution, those messages influence the participant&apos;s context.

<h2 id="34-evaluation">3.4 Evaluation</h2>
<p>Evaluation is needed to verify that the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> objectives have been achieved.

<h3 id="observer-support-tool-ost">Observer Support Tool (OST)</h3>
<p>Based on the specified objectives of the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>, an observer expects to observe different kinds of behaviour. At the same time, there is little time during a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> to record behaviour, as the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> runs on, and that&apos;s why the observer tool provides <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>-specific pre-made forms (templates) to quickly create a new observation. For example, <em>Did you observe role X do Y? Yes/No</em>. These <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">trial</a>-specific forms are created before the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> by the observation team manager in the administration panel based on the data collection plan (as described in the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> Guidance Methodology). Using this panel, specific forms can be assigned to specific observers. The observer can use a tablet, phone or desktop application for his work.</p>
<p>The Observer Support Tool, therefore, records all observations from the observers digitally, so they can be analysed during and after the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>.

The same application can also be accessed on a browser or a normal laptop or desktop computer, for instance for participants to fill in the questionnaires and for the Evaluation coordinator to prepare the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> specific observation templates (i.e. checklists) and questionnaires.

All collected observation and questionnaire data is thereafter shared with the After-Action-Review tool, such that it is centrally stored for evaluation.</p>
<p>Although the observer tool (see Figure 15) can run standalone, outside of the Test-bed context, there are several benefits when it is connected, since this allows:</p>
<ul>
<li>To share observations with <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> staff: they can use this information to steer the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> in a particular direction.</li>
<li>The After-Action-Review tool can record the observations so they can be used during the analysis and evaluation.</li>

<li>Observation forms can be created dynamically and transmitted to selected observers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the observer tool enables the collection of personal data, research ethics is outside the scope of this technically-oriented document, and is being described in more detail in <a href="https://www.driver-project.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DRIVERPLUS_D923.11_Functional-Specification-of-the-Test-bed.pdf" target="_blank">D923.21 - Trial guidance methodology and guidance tool specifications (version 1)</a>.</p>

<p>A successful <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> partially depends on the ability to analyse the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> in depth afterwards.

<h2 id="35-simulation">3.5 Simulation</h2>
<p>Much can be said on the subject of simulation, but for the purpose of this chapter, it suffices to provide a brief overview of the Test-bed&apos;s relation to simulation.</p>
<p>In the Test-bed, the goal of simulation is to provide a realistic, immersive background for the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>. Typically, this requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>simulation of the incident</strong> e.g. a flooding, earthquake or explosion, etc. simulation</li>
<li>A <strong>simulation of the reactions</strong> to the incident, e.g. people running away or drowning, buildings collapsing, road jams or traffic accidents, etc.</li>
<li>A <strong>simulation of the perceived world</strong>, i.e. painting a picture of the world to solutions of what they are reasonably expected to see, not what is actually happening. For example, when an area is flooded in the simulation, all simulators know the exact location of the water. So if people are standing knee-deep in the water, or a road is inaccessible due to water, that can be shown and used. However, a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cop" class="glossary-term" title="Common Operational Picture tools for creating a shared situational awareness">COP</a> tool or other solution does not have such a perfect view of what is happening in the world. It does not know where everyone is, nor the exact location of the water level. As long as it has no sensors, cameras, drones, or people informing it, it may well believe that the flooding is in an entirely different location or not happening at all. For example, during a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cm" class="glossary-term" title="Crisis Management, a holistic management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten an organization and provides a framework for building resilience, with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of the organization&apos;s key interested parties, reputation, brand and value creating activities, as well as effectively restoring operational capabilities. Note to entry: Crisis management also involves the management of preparedness, mitigation, response, and continuity or recovery in the event of an incident, as well as management of the overall programme through training, rehearsals and reviews to ensure the preparedness, response and continuity plans stay current and up-to-date.">CM</a> <a href="GLOSSARY.html#exercise" class="glossary-term" title="An exercise is an activity carried out to train personnel and processes in crisis management.">exercise</a>, it took the participants quite some time to figure out that the water was actually threatening their own location, and they had not taken the necessary precautions. A well-designed <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>, therefore, needs to think about how they are going to present the simulated world within the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Test-bed, therefore, offers support to simulators for creating this realistic and immersive background, by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing a <a href="https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/test-bed-time-service" target="_blank">time-service and GUI</a> (see Figure 18): i.e. each adapter knows the scenario time, so simulators and solutions can use this in their user interface and calculations. Think of a clock display, but also when sending an email or CAP message, making sure it uses the correct timestamps.</li>
<li>The <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>-Management-Tool, as discussed above.</li>
</ul>
<figure id="fig1.5.11"><img src="img/test-bed-time-service.png" alt="In case no TMT is running, the Test-bed time-service GUI can also be used to start/stop/pause a Trial, as well as set the simulation speed"><figcaption>Figure 18.

<p>It does not, however, provide these simulators as an integral part of the Test-bed. They are, and shall always remain, external. And even though some simulators will be connected during the project, they are not bound by the open source requirements that the Test-bed has to adhere too. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>XVR connects their 3D crisis management environment, Crisis Media and Resource Manager to the Test-bed, thereby offering their (commercial) services to other parties too.</li>
<li>DLR connects their open source SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) traffic simulator to the Test-bed, which provides realistic traffic during an incident.</li>
<li>Thales connects their commercial Crowd Simulator SE-STAR to the Test-bed, e.g. providing a realistic simulation of people in need during a crisis.</li>
<li>TNO connects their critical infrastructure and chain effects simulator to the Test-bed, providing insights into the cascading effects of failing infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a recent paper at the SUMO User Conference in 2019, <a href="https://easychair.org/publications/paper/Mwlj" target="_blank">Co-simulation of vehicles and crowds for rescue trials</a>, the connection between XVR OnScene (3D view), SUMO and SE-STAR has been demonstrated and explained in depth.</p>
<h3 id="a-note-about-simulators">A note about Simulators</h3>
<p>All simulators have their own data model of how they represent the simulated world. The <a href="GLOSSARY.html#css" class="glossary-term" title="Common Simulation Space for exchanging simulation data between simulators.">CSS</a> allows these simulators to agree on a communication form that the simulators understand to create and maintain a jointly simulated world.</p>
<p>The simulators only need to be concerned with maintaining the current state of a given location (including entities and processes present at that location), and do not have to deal with the different kinds of communication types for tools and users to depict that current state.</p>
<p>The <a href="GLOSSARY.html#css" class="glossary-term" title="Common Simulation Space for exchanging simulation data between simulators.">CSS</a> allows simulators to only focus on maintaining the current state of the simulated world (i.e. the simulated truth of the incident and the world around it). In order to communicate state changes with other simulators inside the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#css" class="glossary-term" title="Common Simulation Space for exchanging simulation data between simulators.">CSS</a>, self-created communication messages are allowed inside this space.</p>

Note to entry: Crisis management also involves the management of preparedness, mitigation, response, and continuity or recovery in the event of an incident, as well as management of the overall programme through training, rehearsals and reviews to ensure the preparedness, response and continuity plans stay current and up-to-date.">CM</a> organisations, there is also a growing need in the Defence domain for urban battlespaces. Whereas battles of the past were mostly conducted in the open, modern battles are typically conducted in an urban environment, and kinetic simulators and training environments must be enhanced with urban environments and their typical characteristics: critical infrastructures, social media, cyber and sensor networks. The Test-bed is, therefore, also useful in the Defence domain.</p>
<p>Finally, also the police has an increasing need for such tooling: terrorist attacks, manhunts or large scale public events are often not isolated to a single location and may generate multiple incidents, requiring regional and national cooperation. Having an environment to train such large scale incidents should be beneficial for them too. Ideally, required functionality would be specified together with the Police Academy.</p>
<p>It would even be interesting to see if the Test-bed, and especially the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#tmt" class="glossary-term" title="The Trial-Management-Tool acts as the composer and conductor of a classical performance:">TMT</a>, can be used to recreate the timeline in crime-fighting. Take the example of an assassination, abduction or finding a missing child: create a main storyline based on the known facts. For each hypothesis, add a new storyline that fills in the gaps and analyse it. Does the alibi of X hold, or may he have met Y somewhere in between. Get a better impression of the relevant time period when watching public CCTV camera&apos;s or reviewing social media photos.</p>
<p>These combined needs may lead to the following future functionality.</p>
<h3 id="test-bed">Test-bed</h3>
<p>The Test-bed could be enhanced with additional services, some being actively developed, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <a href="https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/email-gateway" target="_blank">email gateway service</a>, to forward Test-bed messages to email clients and receive emails. In case emails are based on fixed templates, these templates can be interpreted by a computer and trigger events or sent to other solutions.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/geo-fencer" target="_blank">geo-fencing service</a>, triggering events when a participant, resource or simulated entity cross a pre-set geographic location.</li>
<li>Gateway to <a href="GLOSSARY.html#hla" class="glossary-term" title="The high-level architecture (HLA) is a general purpose architecture for distributed computer simulation systems. Using HLA, computer simulations can interact (that is, to communicate data, and to synchronize actions) with other computer simulations regardless of the computing platforms. The interaction between simulations is managed by a run-time infrastructure (RTI). HLA is an interoperability standard for distributed simulation used to support analysis, engineering and training in a number of different domains in both military and civilian applications and is the standard technical architecture for all US Department of Defence simulations.">HLA</a> (especially the REAPER FOM) or <a href="GLOSSARY.html#dis" class="glossary-term" title="Distributed Interactive Simulation, a simulation standard en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Interactive_Simulation.">DIS</a>, to improve interoperability.</li>
<li>Map services for sharing maps.</li>
<li>A communication service so voice and chat messages can be recorded.</li>
<li>Adapters in Rust, C++ and Go.</li>
<li>Text-to-speech services, so phone calls can be generated and replace role-players.</li>
<li>Speech-to-text services, so phone calls can trigger events, e.g. a phone call including a menu, requesting a dyke break at a certain location in order to spare the city.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="GLOSSARY.html#admin-tool" class="glossary-term" title="The admin tool provides the technical administrator of the Test-bed with a overview of all the services that are running.">Admin tool</a> already provides most required functionality, and required enhancements are documenten on <a href="https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/test-bed-admin/issues" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. They are mostly minor things, like improved editing of the configuration, add sorting or filtering of info logs.</p>
<p>The <a href="GLOSSARY.html#tmt" class="glossary-term" title="The Trial-Management-Tool acts as the composer and conductor of a classical performance:">TMT</a>&apos;s enhancements are documented on <a href="https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/scenario-manager/issues" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding new message types should be simpler.</li>
<li>Allowing for life edits such that the staff can inject new messages on the fly.</li>
<li>Allow to start a scenario &apos;in the middle&apos;, i.e. skipping part of the scenario. For example, to jump to an interesting scene or during debugging or integrating.</li>
<li>Listening to external messages, like a trigger from the geo-fencing service, informing the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#tmt" class="glossary-term" title="The Trial-Management-Tool acts as the composer and conductor of a classical performance:">TMT</a> that something relevant has occurred, or a voice command via phone or chat to start a storyline.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#ost" class="glossary-term" title="The online observer support tool facilitates the task of the observer by providing him or her with pre-made questions that can be easily answered during a Trial or exercise, and scenario triggers informing the observer of things to come. In addition, these responses will be harvested by the Test-bed, and used for evaluation at the end of the exercise.">OST</a>, the main focus is on better user-friendliness, making it easier to create new observations, and improved analysis capability. And finally, for the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#aar" class="glossary-term" title="The After-Action-Review (AAR) tool provides the possibility to collect data after a Trial has finished and analyse it. Its main purpose is to facilitate the evaluation of the trialled solutions against the predefined objectives, and to help the participants determine how well they functioned. It collects messages (exchanged during Trial), observation reports and takes screen-shots of the applications during their use.">AAR</a>, support capturing screenshots or video from running solutions.</p>
