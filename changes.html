<li>Included a remark that the Test-bed is also useful for supporting table top or field exercises, even if this is out-of-scope.</li>
<li>In Use Case 2.1, added a manual Test-bed creation mode. In practice, Test-beds are mostly created by technical people, and they prefer to work directly with the text-based <a href="GLOSSARY.html#docker" class="glossary-term" title="Docker is a free software application, available on Linux, Mac and Windows, which offers a way to run other applications in its own sand-box environment without requiring installation. Basically, a single PC can run many different Docker files, where each Docker file represents an application. This is also called virtualisation, as a single PC runs many services as if it was server park. A Docker-compose file, then, combines many Docker files into one, each representing a dedicated service of our Test-bed or an external solution, such as the csCOP tool.">Docker</a> images files.</li>
<li>In Alternative 1, Cloud scenario, the actually implemented cloud scenario is added. It turned out that the effort required for the ideal situation was too high, compared to the low effort needed for the current implementation.</li>
<li>In Alternative 1, Local scenario, the current way-of-working is added.</li>
<li>Slightly updated Use Case 2.2 to reflect the latest state.</li>

<li>Added an overview of the type of messages that can be exchanged.</li>
<li>Added direct link to <a href="GLOSSARY.html#tgm" class="glossary-term" title="Trial Guidance Methodology, see also DRIVER+ deliverable D922.21 - Trial guidance methodology and guidance tool specifications (version 1).">TGM</a> handbook.</li>

<li>Time: improved consistency, scenario time is always referred to as <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">trial</a> time.</li>
<li><a href="GLOSSARY.html#hla" class="glossary-term" title="The high-level architecture (HLA) is a general purpose architecture for distributed computer simulation systems. Using HLA, computer simulations can interact (that is, to communicate data, and to synchronize actions) with other computer simulations regardless of the computing platforms. The interaction between simulations is managed by a run-time infrastructure (RTI). HLA is an interoperability standard for distributed simulation used to support analysis, engineering and training in a number of different domains in both military and civilian applications and is the standard technical architecture for all US Department of Defence simulations.">HLA</a>: There is nowadays the option to use C#.</li>
