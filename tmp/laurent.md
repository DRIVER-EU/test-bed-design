Dear Erik,

Here are (below and attached) the remarks made by Antoine and Myself on your document.

Antoine: The document is clean and clear.
The major remarks:
0) The same illustration appears twice - scope fot he Test-bed- and -...and -explanation of the Test-bed components-... plus the title explanation does not seem convenient for just a drawing...
1) Scenario manager: there is a screen shot of the one we don't have, but no one of the one we have (if we have it....)
2) Role of "developer" is not defined before appearing in the text.
3) the text of CIS and CSS could be moved to the dedicated chapters.

Other minor remarks are in the attached PDF.

T0013404 is Antoine Thales code name ;-).

Laurent: 
On my side I started by checking the executive summary and ...the conclusion.
1) There is no conclusion ! Yet, I think that would be feasible and beneficial: we badly need a perspective on what has been realized vs/ what was planned, on the roadmap, on problem that were faced during the implementation and workaround, additional features that would be needed, how this was tested...

2) Reading the executive summary I saw that AAR, Scenario Manager, and data-sets and basic scenarios were supposed to be included in this version " (beware this sentence saound like it was written for the first version of the document and not updated... + is that really true ?

Going from there I checked the AAR, and Scenario manager: both sections are very dry, much too synthetic; The document just reorients the reader to other documents. This is not satisfying for the reader.

Although this is of interest to me for example, I have no idea what it does. Maye  the Specifications docuemnt provides more specification, but how to get there, use it... would be beneficial. because there will be no usual manual after that, right ?  So this should also provdie more material to the actual user...

Sorry for providing these remarks a bit late.
We hope this helps and are avaialble for discussion any time next week.

Enjoy your WE.

Best regards,

Laurent.
