Dear Erik,

Thanks for the improvements. I would actually prefer to have a clear technical description, as it is a technical matter, but we need to address the comments still. 

-	Target audience I also agree. It should be better explained who is the user of the information. 

-	Although the Test-bed lacks a technical integration of non-technical solution, I think the potential is higher than explained in the document. It is true that non-technical solution cannot exchange data via IT-interfaces, but they might still make use of the CSS. They might require information about the crisis as well and make use of simulated data. Question is, in how far the information is actually accessible without having a tool, which makes them human readable. Is there a data viewers or something? Still, non-technical solution might also exchange information manually with other solutions. The DRIVER+ solution definition includes the operator, hence a human component. If the Test-bed completely ignores non-technical solutions, we might at some point receive the feedback that we lack support for them. I can understand that it is not that straight forward to explain a non-technical integration, as it is not fixed to the CIS frame, but is it really out of scope?

-	Reviewers might be wondering what is the relation between the Test-bed composer solution selection and the Trial Guidance Tool / PoS. I think it would be good to state that in the document.
_Added a description of the composer_

-	Security: Promoting an authorization scheme as full-fledged security chapter might raise criticism as it does not address data encryption, confidentiality etc. in any why. I suggest to just name is �Authorization� and refer to it as a contribution to the security of the system.
_Explicitly added it to the title_

-	Given the comments from the reviewers (although I would prefer a reviewer if the sufficient background), Hector provided a very good suggestion to solve that issue. I fully support his comments.
_Done_

-	Some more details in addition to the comments provided by Hector and Chiara in the PDF attached.

Greetings,
Michael
