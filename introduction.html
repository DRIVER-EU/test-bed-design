Their aim is to be more efficient and effective, save more lives, against fewer costs. Some of the ways to achieve this are to improve existing <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cm" class="glossary-term" title="Crisis Management, a holistic management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten an organization and provides a framework for building resilience, with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of the organization&apos;s key interested parties, reputation, brand and value creating activities, as well as effectively restoring operational capabilities.

<ol>
<li><p>PREPARATION PHASE:</p>
<ul>
<li>The operational issues practitioners experience are matched with one or more of the well-known crisis management gaps, as experienced by many of their colleagues, e.g. <em>How to get a real-time and dynamic overview of the position of all personnel?</em>.</li>
<li>These gaps, in turn, are still too generic to address, and are made more specific, leading to so-called &apos;research questions&apos;, e.g. <em>Which Situational Awareness-increasing solution fits best with our mode of operation?</em></li>
<li>Existing solutions are reviewed and selected. Some solutions can even be tried out standalone using the Test-bed and an existing mini-scenario.</li>
<li>Based on the selected solutions, gaps and research questions, a data collection plan is developed: what kind of data does the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> need to generate to enable a valid evaluation at the end of the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>.</li>
<li>A scenario is developed that puts these solutions to the test. This includes selecting and connecting simulators of a fictive incident, e.g. a flooding simulator, and other simulators to create a realistic environment, e.g. a traffic simulator.</li>
<li>Selected solutions and existing legacy systems are connected to the Test-bed, so they can receive input from the simulators as well as each other.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>EXECUTION PHASE:</p>
<p>The Test-bed is setup, all simulators and solutions are connected, data collection is in place, and a scenario can be run (executed). Before the actual <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>, several dry runs are performed, partially for testing the setup, and partially for training the participants in using the solutions. This phase ends when the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> is executed and observed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>EVALUATION PHASE:</p>
<p>Based on the recorded observations and collected data (screenshots of running applications, messages sent, actions and decisions taken) during the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a>, the solutions are evaluated with the participants, leading to a good appreciation of how the selected solutions have contributed to solving the problems.</p>

<p>This document limits its scope to the core Test-bed design, more specifically, the design of the Test-bed&apos;s reference implementation, which is an implementation of the <a href="https://driver-eu.gitbooks.io/test-bed-specification" target="_blank">Test-bed specification</a> (see Figure 3): it thereby provides an overview of the most important components of the Test-bed, how they work together, and how they can be used by different stakeholders.</p>

The simulators&apos; function is to simulate an incident, and the reactions that may occur in a real world, since we cannot unleash incidents like a flooding and earthquakes on the real world. The solutions are the actual tools that are trialled and evaluated, and measured whether they actually do solve a <a href="GLOSSARY.html#cm" class="glossary-term" title="Crisis Management, a holistic management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten an organization and provides a framework for building resilience, with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of the organization&apos;s key interested parties, reputation, brand and value creating activities, as well as effectively restoring operational capabilities. Note to entry: Crisis management also involves the management of preparedness, mitigation, response, and continuity or recovery in the event of an incident, as well as management of the overall programme through training, rehearsals and reviews to ensure the preparedness, response and continuity plans stay current and up-to-date.">CM</a> gap. These solutions are fed with the simulator&apos;s output, and perhaps the output of other solutions, so end users can observe and evaluate their contribution during a fictive incident.</p>
<h2 id="13-organisation-of-the-document">1.3 Organisation of the Document</h2>
<p>This is a live document, and the latest version can always be found online at <a href="https://https://driver-eu.github.io/test-bed-design" target="_blank">https://driver-eu.github.io/test-bed-design</a>. It is organised as follows:</p>
<p>For <strong>reviewers</strong>, please refer to <a href="changes.html">Annex 2 Change history</a> to see what has changed since the previous version. In order to quickly understand the Test-bed, have a look at the <a href="https://vimeo.com/299680658" target="_blank">5 minutes animation at https://vimeo.com/299680658</a>.</p>
<p>The chapter, <a href="Trial-owners.md">Test-bed for Trial owners</a>, is specifically aimed at <strong><a href="GLOSSARY.html#trial" class="glossary-term" title="An event for systematically assessing solutions for current and emerging needs in such a way that practitioners can do this following a pragmatic and systematic approach.">Trial</a> owners and practitioners</strong>, and discusses the functionality the Test-bed offers to them. And also, what it does not offer.</p>
<p>The <a href="test-bed-description.html">Test-bed description</a> provides a general overview of the Test-bed reference implementation and its building blocks. It is a more technical chapter aimed at Test-bed users with a (limited) technical background.</p>
<p>In the chapter, <a href="developers.html">Test-bed for developers and sysops</a>, the technical side of the Test-bed is explained in more detail. Specifically: how to manage a Test-bed as a sysop, or how to connect a new Solution or simulator as a developer. To learn more about the design principles underlying the Test-bed, the reader is referred to <a href="design.html">Annex 3 Test-bed design</a>.</p>
<h2 id="14-whats-new">1.4 What&apos;s new</h2>
<h3 id="version-1-2018-03-31">Version 1 (2018-03-31)</h3>
<p>This is deliverable D923.21, describing the first version of the Test-bed reference implementation. It matches the release version of the software applications as available on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/DRIVER-EU" target="_blank">github.com/DRIVER-EU</a>. Two future releases of this document are planned, v2 and v3, and the major changes between the different documents will be described here. In the mean time, this online documentation is continuously updated, so it matches the current state of the Test-bed.</p>
<h3 id="version-2-2018-11-30">Version 2 (2018-11-30)</h3>
<p>This is deliverable D923.22, describing the second version of the Test-bed reference implementation v2. All changes with respect to the previous version are documented in <a href="changes.html">Annex 2 Change history</a>.</p>
<h3 id="version-3-2019-08-31">Version 3 (2019-08-31)</h3>
<p>This is deliverable D923.23, describing the third and final version of the Test-bed reference implementation v3. All changes with respect to the previous version are documented in <a href="changes.html">Annex 2 Change history</a>.</p>
